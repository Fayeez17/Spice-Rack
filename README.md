# Spice-Rack

Spice Rack is a web application where users simply input the ingredients available in their kitchen and the app will generate recipe suggestions based on those ingredients.

The app also consider dietary preferences and restrictions, such as vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free options.

Users can browse through suggested recipes, view detailed cooking instructions.
